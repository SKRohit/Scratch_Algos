# Scratch_Algos
###Minimalistic implementations of different ML algorithms from scratch.

**Few of the implementations are:
1. SVM Classifier with Gradient Descent for optimisation
2. Self Organising Maps
3. Simple Logistic Regression with Newton's Method for optimisation
4. K-Means Clustering
5. Principal Component Analysis
6. Naive Bayes Spam Classifier
7. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
